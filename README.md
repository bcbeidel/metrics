# metrics

dbt package to facilitate the calculation of consistent metrics across cloud warehouses

## Assumptions

This package assumes that you have created models that in a structure similar to the following example file(s):

- [examples/seeds/user_mapping.csv](examples/seeds/user_mapping.csv): Identifies which queries are considered 'users' rather than programmatic accounts

## Installation

1. Include this package in your `packages.yml`
2. Run `dbt deps`
3. Include the following in your `dbt_project.yml` directly within your `vars`

```YAML
# dbt_project.yml
config-version: 2

...

vars:
  # location of table that maps user emails to boolean 'is_user_account'
  metrics__user_mapping_table:
  # number of days of job history to include in metrics calculation
  metrics__days_of_history: 90
  # Service Level Objective for query speed; 95th percentile of user queries
  # i.e., 95% of user queries should be faster than this number in seconds
  metrics__p95_query_duration_seconds_SLO: 10
  # Service Level Objective for query speed; 99th percentile of user queries
  # i.e., 99% of user queries should be faster than this number in seconds
  metrics__p99_query_duration_seconds_SLO: 60
```

4. Execute `dbt run --full-refresh` for the first iteration â€“ the models will get built as part of your run!
5. Execute `dbt run` for future runs, leveraging the built-in [incremental models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/configuring-incremental-models).
